I am an Associate Professor at Vision, Learning and Control Group ([VLC](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/groups/vision-learning-control)), School of Electrical and Computer Science ([ECS](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/)), [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), UK. I am now closely affiliated with [UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Sustainability](https://sustai.info/). Previously I obtained Ph.D on machine learning from School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, UK.

I have been focusing on machine learning, particularly, deep learning, broadly covering its theory, methodology and application. Together with my students and collaborators, we attempt to **rigorously reveal the underlying mechanism of why deep learning works or not**, and inspired by our theoretical understanding and empirical observation, we develop **robust, fast and generalizable models and algorithms** to boost its applicability in various challenging scenarios and **interdisciplinary tasks**, e.g. ML4Science.  More information is shown in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2sHceIAAAAJ) profile. 



### Research Interests:
- Understanding deep learning theoretically ([SGD](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhu19e/zhu19e.pdf), [BN](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/326a8c055c0d04f5b06544665d8bb3ea-Paper.pdf), [Implicit Bias](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PjBEUTVzoe), [Knowledge Distillation](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/ef0d3930a7b6c95bd2b32ed45989c61f-Paper.pdf))
- Robust deep learning models in adversarial and continual environments ([YOPO](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/812b4ba287f5ee0bc9d43bbf5bbe87fb-Paper.pdf), [Learning dynamics of adversarial training](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=l8It-0lE5e7), [RCL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/cee631121c2ec9232f3a2f028ad5c89b-Paper.pdf) and [BOCL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9477031)) 
- Lightweight and fast large language models (LLMs, *ongoing*)
- Time series modeling and prediction ([STGCN](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0505.pdf), [STFGN](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/16542/16349), [Neural Lad](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bISkJSa5Td), [Functional Relation Field](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370224000948))
- Machine learning for science (ML4Science), particularly biological problems.
