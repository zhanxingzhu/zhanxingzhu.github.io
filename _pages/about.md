I am an Associate Professor at Vision, Learning and Control Group ([VLC](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/groups/vision-learning-control)), School of Electrical and Computer Science ([ECS](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science)), [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), UK. I am now closely affiliated with [UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Sustainability](https://sustai.info/). Previously I obtained Ph.D on machine learning from School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, UK.

I have been focusing on machine learning, particularly, deep learning, broadly covering its theory, methodology and application. Together with my students and collaborators, we attempt to **rigorously reveal the underlying mechanism of why deep learning works or not**, and inspired by our theoretical understanding and empirical observation, we develop **robust, fast and generalizable models and algorithms** to boost its applicability in various challenging scenarios and **interdisciplinary tasks**, e.g. **AI4Science** and **AI4Engineering**.  More information is shown in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2sHceIAAAAJ) profile.
